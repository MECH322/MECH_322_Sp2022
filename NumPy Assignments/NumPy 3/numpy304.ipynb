    "\n",
    "Crank-slider mechanisms are used in many engineering applications. Create a function named **`crank_slider_plot(crank, coupler, rpm)`** that calculates and plots the position $x$, velocity $v$, and acceleration $a$ of the slider (piston) versus time for one revolution of a crank that turns as a constant angular velocity $\\omega$. Make three vertically stacked subplots in the same figure. Set the crank angle to $\\theta = 0^{\\circ}$ when the time is $t=0$ seconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the crank is turning at a constant angular velocity $\\omega$, we know the angular acceleration $\\alpha$ is zero. Use the following expressions to determine the position $x$ of the piston based upon the crank angle $\\theta$:\n",
