    "Define a function named `projectile_plot(velocity, angle, values=200)` that calculates the trajectory of a projectile. The required arguments to the function are the initial velocity and the angle in degrees at which the projectile is fired. The function also accepts an optional third argument with a default value of 200 that sets the number of plot points. The function should return a tuple with the maximum height and the horizontal distance traveled. In addition to the return values, the function should generate an $x,y$ plot of the trajectory.\n",

Include your name in the docstring. Do not print anything from the function; just return the specified values and create the plot.\n",
