    "\n",
    "Low-pass filters are used in some sensing systems to filter out unwanted frequencies above a specific frequency known as the cut-off frequency $f_c$ (in Hz). The relative effectiveness of the filter is determined by the magnitude ratio $M$. The calculation for $M$ as a function of $f$ for a Butterworth low-pass filter is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\qquad\\displaystyle M(f) = \\frac{1}{(1 + (f/f_c)^{2k})^{1/2}}$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $f$ is a signal frequency in Hz and $k$ is the filter order of the low-pass filter being used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Often the magnitude ratio is plotted versus the ratio $f/f_c$ (also known as the relative frequency).\n",
    "\n",
    "Write the function named **`lowpass_filter(k_list)`**\n",
    "- That accepts a list of $k$ values as an argument\n",
    "- Uses a `for` loop to iterate over the list of $k$ values and do the following:\n",
    "  - Create a list of $M$ values for relative frequencies ($f/f_c$) from 0 to 2\n",
    "  - Create a subplot for each $k$ value of $M$ (y-axis) versus $f/f_c$ (x-axis)\n",
    "  - Calculate and report $M$ for the following frequency ratios at each $k$ value...\n",
    "    - 0.75\n",
    "    - 1.0\n",
    "    - 1.5\n",
    "- **Plot details**\n",
    "  - Stacked subplots\n",
    "  - Use `fig, ax = plt.subplots()`\n",
    "    - Where `fig` is the figure name\n",
    "    - Where `ax` is the axes list name\n",
    "    - Set the appropriate argument based on the number of $k$ values requested to yield the correct number of subplots\n",
    "    - Use `ax[i]` (or similar) in the loop to plot/change the correct subplot\n",
    "    - Include the keyword argument `sharex=True` in the `.subplots()` method\n",
    "  - Use 101 data points for each subplot\n",
    "  - Plot the following (in the order listed) in each subplot...\n",
    "    1. The primary data using `.fill_between()` with the default color\n",

    "    - 0 to 2 for the $x$-axis\n",
    "    - 0 to 1 for the $y$-axis\n",
    "  - Include the title above each plot **\"Magnitude Ratio for a Low Pass Filter with k = X\"**\n",

    "  - A single $x$-axis label **\"Relative Frequency (f/fc)\"** on the bottom plot only\n",
    "    - Do this outside the loop using appropriate indexing to access the last plot axes\n",
    "  - $y$-axis labels of **\"M\"** for each subplot \n",
    "  - Outside of the loop, use `plt.tight_layout()` before `plt.show()` to clean up the subplot spacing\n",
    "- **Printed output**\n",

    "  - Print a \"header statement\" before the $M$ results statements that states the $k$ value\n",

When plotting or creating a list of calculated values, we often desire a list with a particular non-integer step size. The following function definition was created with that task in mind.
