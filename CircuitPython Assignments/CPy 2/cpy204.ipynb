    "Connect a motor to the CPB per the supplied diagram. Use commands from the **`pwmio`** and **`adafruit_circuitplayground`** modules to control the speed of the motor from the REPL, built-in buttons, and built-in slide switch. Make sure you use the Vout not a 3.3V connector to provide power to the motor.\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a motor object using the **`motor = pwmio.PWMOut(board.D10, frequency=1600)`** function call. Recall that connector A3 is also D10. To control the motor speed you need to set its duty cycle to an integer value between 0 (off) and 65535 (full speed) like so; **`motor.duty_cycle = 32000`**. You can check the current duty cycle using **`motor.duty_cycle`**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In your main loop continuously watch the status of the slide switch. If the slide switch is in the left position, use an **`input()`** function to request a motor speed between 0 and 100. If a value less than 0 is input, use 0 to set the speed. If a value greater than 100 is input, use 100. Then set the motor duty cycle between 0 and 65535 based upon the input value (you will need to scale the input value to do so).\n",
    "\n",
    "If slide switch is in the right position, use the built-in buttons A and B to decrease or increase (respectively) the motor speed in 10% increments between 0 and 100%. Add a 0.25 second delay after setting the duty cycle to allow for the button to be released. Your code should not allow the speed to be set below 0 or above 100% (a duty cycle of 65535).\n",
    "\n",
    "Each time the motor speed is changed (regardless of the method used), print both the speed as a percentage and the duty cycle to the REPL using string formatting. Your output should look something like this; **`Motor speed = XX% (duty cycle = XXXXX)`**. The motor speed percentage and duty cycle should both be displayed to the nearest integer.\n",
