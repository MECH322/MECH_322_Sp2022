    "## Creating Strings\n",
    "\n",
    "- Objects that contain alphabetic text characters are called **strings**\n",
    "- Strings can be as short as single character\n",
    "- Strings do not have to contain just letters \n",
    "- They can contain nearly any character (including Unicode characters like emoticons)\n",
    "- Strings are defined by surrounding the text with a set of single or double quotes\n",
    "- For example, `'parrot'` and `\"Lumberjack\"`\n",
    "- Including apostrophes and/or a set of quotes within strings\n",
    "  - Use an *escape sequence*\n",
    "    - `\\'` to include an apostrophe in a single quoted string, i.e. `'isn\\'t'`\n",
    "    - `\\\"` to include double quotes in a double quoted string, i.e. `\"\\\"hello\\\"\"`\n",
    "    - `\\\\` to include an actual back slash character\n",
    "  - Use double quotes for strings with apostrophes in them, i.e. `\"can't\"`\n",
    "  - Use single quotes for strings with double quotes in them, i.e. `'She said \"hello.\"'`\n",
    "  - Enclose the string between three sets of single or double quotes, i.e. `\"\"\"\"It's only a flesh wound,\" he declared\"\"\"`\n",
    "  - Three sets of single or double quotes can also be used to wrap multi-line quotes\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    \"\"\"Hello there. This assignment\n",
    "    is all about strings.\"\"\"\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "## String Length\n",
    "- The `len()` function returns the number of characters in a string\n",
    "- `len(\"Python\")` will tell you that the string is 6 characters long"

    "## Accessing Individual String Characters\n",
    "\n",
    "- Strings are lists of characters grouped together but treated as one object\n",
    "- Access specific characters in strings based on their position in the string\n",
    "- All counting in *Python* starts with zero, not one\n",
    "- `\"H\"` in `\"Hello\"` is in the zeroth position (also called the zeroth index)\n",
    "- Access the zeroth character using `\"Hello\"[0]`\n",
    "- Access the first `l` using `\"Hello\"[2]`\n",
    "- This process is referred to as **string indexing**\n",
    "- The last item in `my_string` can be accessed using `my_string[len(my_string)-1]`\n",
    "- You can also index strings from the right end instead of the left\n",
    "- First character from the left is accessed with the index `[0]`\n",
    "- The last character can be indexed directly using `[-1]`\n",
    "- The negative sign says to count from the right end of the string\n",
    "- Indexing from the right starts with `-1` not `-0`, because...\n",
    "  - `-0` is the same as `0` mathematically \n",
    "  - Using `-0` could cause confusion\n",

    "\n",
    "- Can access part of a string (a sub-string) in addition to single characters\n",

    "- Place square brackets after a string or variable with start, stop, and step values separated by colons\n",

    "- `.find()` \n",
    "  - Look for a search string within a target string; `target_string.find(search_string)`\n",

    "  - Two required and one optional argument\n",
    "    - Search string \n",
    "    - New string\n",
    "    - Optional argument is the number of occurrences to replace\n",
