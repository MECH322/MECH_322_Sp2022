    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "*Arduinos* are micro-controllers that can be programmed to control physical devices. In the words of one of the founders, Massimo Banzi, in his book *Getting Started with Arduino*, “*Arduino* is an open source physical computing platform based on a simple input/output (I/O) board and a development environment that implements the Processing language (www.processing.org). *Arduino* can be used to develop standalone interactive objects or can be connect to software on your computer.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Adafruit Industries is currently a manufacturer of US made/sold *Arduino* boards. They modified the design of an *Arduino* board to accept a different processor that can run a version of *Python* called **CircuitPython** (https://circuitpython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?) that does essentially the same tasks as the *Arduino* software. We will be using one of the many available *CircuitPython* boards to learn how to use *Python* to program the real world; the [Circuit Playground Bluefruit](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-circuit-playground-bluefruit/overview). Follow the links to see how to get/update *CircuitPython* on the boards to get up and running.\n",
    "\n",
    "Learning to program a microprocessor board may open your mind to possible Senior Project ideas for machines/devices/systems that need to be controlled and connected to a variety of physical devices/sensors. It may also spark an interest in real world physical computing projects in your everyday life; also known as the Internet of Things (IOT).\n",
